Hi dear GWM'lers,

I'm proud to announce that GWM's release 0.6 is out now and available for download. :)

Some of the great new features you will be able to use are:

* Hide effects when closing frames
* 4 new great themes added to the release
* Setting a theme on GDesktopPane changes all the themes of its GInternalFrame's
* Different themes for selected and unselected frames
* GFrameAdapter added for easier listener management

Improvements which have been made are:

* Better code architecture by refactoring into GFrame/GInternalFrame/GDialog
* Frames with URL content are no longer reloaded when resized
* Faster dragging of frames with different drag modes

Bug fixes of the new release include:

* ListBoxes are no longer visible through frames
* GInternalFrame's visibility bugs have been fixed
* Maximize/Minimize functionality bugs have been fixed
* Closed frames will set all references to null so that it can be garbage collected

Just play with the demo, read the installation/migration guide and grab the release for your project. You will be amazed! :)
